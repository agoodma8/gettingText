Hello this is our first file for CSE350 team project. 
This is our second commit.

To use this document, you need a Java IDE to run the project. 

### What is this repository for? ### 
* This repository is for storing versions of the code for our team project. 
* Version 1

### How do I get set up? ### 
* This program is intended to be run in Java so an installation of a Java IDE is required to run the program. The recommended IDE is Eclipse, but any Java IDE will run the program. 
* To run the program, follow the directions below:
    Step 1. Select the ‘Select Input File’ button and browse for any text file.
    Step 2. Open the text file in the program.
    Step 3. Select the ‘Select Output File’ button and browse for any text file. Note: this will overwrite the previous file.
    Step 4. Select the ‘Format’ button.
* This program depends on the input file being a text file with only English characters.
* To run a test, input a sample text formula into the 'select file' button and click 'format' to see the formatted output in a new output text file.

### Who do I talk to? ###
* Abdullah Alfairouz, Avi Goodman, Ryan Karlovsky, Kaijene Roberts
